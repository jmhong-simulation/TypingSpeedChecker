The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions";[5] and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages".
